Custom chapters is a **paid** feature for crowd-sourcing specific sections inside of videos. Some people get free access, and this can be found by checking the settings page.

These custom sections can be made inside eachother to make more-and-more specific sections. This also allows for better collaboration, as you can easily add to someone else's chapter submissions by making more precise chapters inside of theirs.

Here is a demo:
