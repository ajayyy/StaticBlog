# What is this

As announced in [this post](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@ajayyy/youtube-watch-history-statistics-viewer), YouTube Watch History Statistic Viewer is a program that displays stats like the videos you've you've watched the most, channels you've watched the most, and categories you've watched the most on YouTube.

# What's in the Update

Google doesn't save your watch history forever, so now I have included a feature to save your watch history database to load later. Now, you can save your watch history database every year, and get a year by year statistic viewer of the whole history of your viewing on YouTube.

I have also made a nice download page to show off features of the program.
