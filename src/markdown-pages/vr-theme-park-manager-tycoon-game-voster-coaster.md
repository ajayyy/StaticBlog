# Video of current progress

Placing roller coasters and paths, and moving them around.

# What is this

I recently got a VR headset and then remembered this [really awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE0_oyK1Juo) and decided I wanted to make this a reality.

This is going to be a VR theme park management game and roller coaster builder. I plan to implement all the features of a theme park management tycoon game, the ability to build roller coasters, rides, food stands, paths, and need to manager your money the whole time. I also want to make it so that you can switch from miniature mode, to human scale to walk around your park like it was a real thing.

# Technology

This being built with Unity and the SteamVR plugin. The headset I own is the Samsung Oddesey Windows MR headset, but I'm building it with SteamVR so that it will support all major PC based VR headsets.

This is a room scale game, meaning you can walk around.

# Contributing

I plan on making some task requests for some 3D models in the future, but for now, if you want to help me with the project, you can [join my discord](https://discord.gg/6TAPnTx) so that we can coordinate our work.

To help with the programming, you must have a VR headset, download Unity, SteamVR, and then open the project in Unity.

For helping with models, you do not need a VR headset as you would not need to test the full game.

# Try it out

If you do want to try it out and have a VR headset, you can download an alpha build [here](https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoasterVR/releases).
