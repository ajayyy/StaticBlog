On one side, you get one power up in exchange for two sacrifices. You may choose which you would like by pressing A or D.</p>\n<p>Each death, you must make a sacrifice, which usually are some crazy visual effect on the screen.</p>\n<h1>Technology Stack</h1>\n<p>This is built with Java and an awesome open source library called Lib-GDX. This allows you to have full access to all OpenGL functions (through LWJGL) in Java. There are also some shaders used (for the colour changing visual effect and the lighting visual effect). These are written with GLSL. The \"Bloom\" post processing effect is created using <a href=\"https://github.com/manuelbua/libgdx-contribs/\">a post processing plugin</a>.</p>\n<h1>Features</h1>\n<h5>Physics</h5>\n<p>The physics is programmed in mannually and is meant to be as modifiable as possible. This is done to ensure that the powerups and negative powers can easily change how the physics work to make it easier or harder.</p>\n<h5>Expandable Power Up System</h5>\n<p>The power up system is easily expandable by making a new <code class=\"language-text\">switch</code> statement in the power up class making even community submitted power ups simple to create.</p>\n<h5>Smoothed out animations</h5>\n<p>To make animations feel smooth, a lerp system is used. This makes the movement ease in.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">float lerp = 2.5f;\nfloat xMovement = ((x - game.main.cam.position.x) * lerp * game.deltaTime);</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This makes the movement much nicer to look at.</p>\n<h5>Random rotation</h5>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1c731.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h5>Screenshake</h5>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1c70f.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h5>Low lighting effect</h5>\n<p>It is made using shaders.
