However, that turned out not to have a noticeable enough difference to matter, and the calculations required way too much time to be feasible to be run every frame.</p>\n<h4>The margin of error calculation</h4>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">//because the track pieces are not actual circles and are made up of straight segments, the margin of error must be calculated\npublic float getDistanceForAngle(float adjustmentAngle, float currentDistance, int amount) {\n\n    //total displacement on each axis\n    float totalX = 0;\n    float totalY = 0;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; amount; i++) {\n        //calculate x value for this segment\n        float x = Mathf.Sin(adjustmentAngle * (i + 1) * Mathf.Deg2Rad) * (currentDistance / Mathf.Sin(Mathf.PI / 2));\n        //calculate y using x in the pythagorean formula\n        float y = Mathf.Sqrt(Mathf.Pow(currentDistance, 2) - Mathf.Pow(x, 2));\n\n        totalX += x;\n        totalY += y;\n    }\n\n    float totalDisplacement = Mathf.Sqrt(Mathf.Pow(totalX, 2) + Mathf.Pow(totalY, 2));\n\n    //find the factor of error this displacement has versus the ideal\n    float differenceFactor = ((rollerCoaster.trackBoneSize / RollerCoaster.scale) * amount) / totalDisplacement;\n\n    //multiply this error factor by the current distance and return it to be the real distance\n    return currentDistance * differenceFactor;\n}</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This function calculates the length of each segment, then calculates the x and y displacement to get there. It then adds all these up and calculates the total displacement to be able to compare it with the perfect displacement (with a circle). This will fix the error, but it is not worth the extra computational time.</p>\n<h4>How the new curve calculations work</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/images/QmZL7tZWNgZtoNw5Di8PR1DhrAXFkjc1ryx73NVBsCB1aP\" alt=\"thing 2.png\"></p>\n<p>In this image, the line on the right represents the start angles (linear formulas), and the left line represents the target. The top red points on each line represent the positions (start and target). A line is created from the start point at the angle <code class=\"language-text\">(180 - targetAngle) / 2</code> (represented by angle A in the diagram). Using this line, the collision point between this line and the target line can be found (represented by the lower red dot on the target line in the diagram). This point and the start point are now two positions on the circle.</p>\n<p>To calculate the radius, a ratio is calculation.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">//y = rsinA, x = rcosA\n//these are the positions of these angles on a circle with a radius of 1\nfloat targetNormalX = Mathf.Cos((-targetAngle.y + 360) * Mathf.Deg2Rad);\nfloat targetNormalY = Mathf.Sin((-targetAngle.y + 360) * Mathf.Deg2Rad);\nfloat startNormalX = Mathf.Cos(startTrackAngleRelative.y * Mathf.Deg2Rad);\nfloat startNormalY = Mathf.Sin(startTrackAngleRelative.y * Mathf.Deg2Rad);\n\n//the radius would be equal to 1 for a circle like this.

This is because the track amounts are stored as integers, and full track pieces are placed each time. This does not produce a smooth or accurate track. To fix this, these numbers need to be saved as floats (number with decimals), and if necessary, only part of the track should be drawn. This makes the track more accurate to reach the target point, and makes the track movement very smooth.</p>\n<p>To do this, the track has to be able to only draw a percentage of the track.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">//cut this off to make sure it is only the percentageOfTrack\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; rails.Length; i++) {\n    for (int r = 1; r &lt; rails[i].Length; r++) {\n        //if the curve start is normal, treat this normally, otherwise just use the start angle\n        if (secondCurveStart == -1) {\n            currentAngle = adjustmentAngle;\n        } else {\n            currentAngle = startAngle;\n        }\n\n        if ((r - 1) / boneAmount &gt; percentageOfTrack &amp;&amp; secondCurveStart != -1) {\n            //if the curve start is not zero, treat the rest of the track as the upcomming angle instead of the start angle\n            rails[i][r].transform.localPosition = defaultBonePosition;\n            rails[i][r].transform.localEulerAngles = adjustmentAngle;\n            rails[i][r].SetActive(true);\n        } else if ((r - 1) / boneAmount &gt; percentageOfTrack &amp;&amp; secondCurveStart == -1) {\n            //if the curve start is zero, then treat the rest of the track as if it does not exist\n            rails[i][r].transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;\n            rails[i][r].transform.localEulerAngles = Vector3.zero;\n            rails[i][r].SetActive(false);\n        } else if ((r + 1 - 1) / boneAmount &gt; percentageOfTrack &amp;&amp; percentageOfTrack != 1) {\n            rails[i][r].transform.localPosition = ((percentageOfTrack - ((r - 1) / boneAmount)) * boneAmount) * defaultBonePosition;\n            rails[i][r].transform.localEulerAngles = ((percentageOfTrack - ((r - 1) / boneAmount)) * boneAmount) * currentAngle;\n            rails[i][r].SetActive(true);\n        }\n    }\n}</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This code cuts the track off if it has passed the percentage needed to draw, and will only draw part of it if necessary.</p>\n<p>This smooths it out a bit, but the way the track is drawn, there are three sections.\n<img src=\"/images/QmTB2MKMxxKxJ3t6Uz6BTfLmGAzSMwCrTY6a9KF6C5uX13\" alt=\"image.png\">\n<img src=\"/images/Qmbe95XSn8MB4249gciu5yxjTteNuDHMnLhEBmmQfPojVj\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>Between each of these, these partial tracks need to be merged into one.
