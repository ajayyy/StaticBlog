At the same time, there are many people who do like the more boring feel created from replacing as many titles as possible.</p>\n<p>To try to improve the experience for everyone, DeArrow is now going to have two different modes. Classic mode will be just like it is today and will remain the default mode, but there will now also be a casual mode.</p>\n<p>The goal with casual mode is to allow people to vote on which original titles they enjoy so that people who prefer not to see the boring titles can avoid them. However, for videos that really do need changes, DeArrow will still be able to replace the titles.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O3JGEDdB6Hc?modestbranding=1&rel=0\" title=\"Demo Video\"\n    frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\"\n    allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n<p>Read more about it on <a href=\"https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/w/DeArrow/Casual_mode\">the wiki</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 07, 2024","path":"/dearrow-casual-mode","title":"DeArrow casual mode"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
