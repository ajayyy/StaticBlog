There can be up to 16 players. You can see more in the <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@ajayyy/turn-based-attacker\">original post</a></p>\n<h1>Networking</h1>\n<p>In this release I added the ability to play a networked game. Now you can have other players join your game and can play together, from different computers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/shboosva3fsoe9wq30p9.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>You can join by specifying their ip address.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uccwpjxxjs3imphmfsgo.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>The game communicates over TCP and sends messages for what button was pressed, or what person became selected. The networking is done manually by sending strings of text signifying a command, and since TCP sometimes groups commands, the game will make sure to separate commands before executing them.</p>\n<p>Since this is a turn based game, I do not have to deal with latency, meaning it just requires sending the data.</p>\n<h1>Future Plans</h1>\n<p>I have already implemented saving and loading games, but I have not implemented that into multiplayer yet (since that would require sending a lot of data over the network. My next plan is to work on loading your game into a multiplayer game.</p>\n<p>I also want to add the ability to add nicknames, and the ability to reconnect if you leave.</p>\n<p>Giving the game host the ability to kick players is also a feature I am planning on adding.</p>\n<h1>Download and Play</h1>\n<p>You can download and play the game <a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/TurnBasedAttacker/releases\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 26, 2018","path":"/turn-based-attacker-networking-lan-multiplayer","title":"Turn Based Attacker - Networking + LAN Multiplayer"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
