This uses the angle and position relative to the last placed track to form either a curve or a straight line.</p>\n<p>This took on many different variations to eventually get working, so I am going to show how it currently works, as well as a summary of a few of the other ways I tried getting it working (as this post would be way too long if I showed them all.</p>\n<h1>Other changes</h1>\n<p>I also reformatted some classes. Instead of having a specific class called AddIncline for managing track adjustments, there is now the TrackPiece class for managing all items related to each track piece, and each track piece has its own instance of the class. The RollerCoaster class then uses these classes to manage the individual track pieces.</p>\n<h1>How you build a roller coaster in this game</h1>\n<p>To build a roller coaster, you point your controller in the direction you want the next segment of the roller coaster to point, and move the controller away from the last placed track. A track new track segment will be made between the last track segment and your controller position, ending off with the angle you are pointing at, turning if necessary.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Qmf4FvA1bN1av1qP5ftP3Yu1SHZ9hTYVhZmjVFBwjKsfP6\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<h1>How this is implemented</h1>\n<p>In the final iteration, I tried to make the system as simple as possible to avoid issues.</p>\n<p>It first creates two linear equations.
