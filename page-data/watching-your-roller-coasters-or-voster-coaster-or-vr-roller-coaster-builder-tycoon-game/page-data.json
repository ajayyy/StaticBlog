I wanted this to be as realistic as possible so that I can later use the data to gather g-forces to know the intensity of roller coasters that are created.</p>\n<h1>Physical approach</h1>\n<p>When I first was thinking of ways to create a preview of your roller coaster, I thought of using the default physics engine. I would create meshes on each track and try to slide a box across the whole thing.</p>\n<p>This started looking like it was going to work perfectly, but sadly it did not because of a small issue in the physics engine. Whenever it got to a crease between the one track pieces collision mesh and another's, there was a chance it would suddenly jump upward.</p>\n<p>This drove me nuts trying to find what was causing this problem. I tried many things to try to fix this.</p>\n<h3>Smooth out the meshes</h3>\n<p>Because of how curves work, the size of the collider might have to be slightly different for each track piece. At first, I thought this was the issue, but fixing sizes did nothing.</p>\n<h3>Wheels</h3>\n<p>In real life, wheels do not slide across a surface, they roll.</p>\n<p>I then attempted to create a rolling ball down the tracks.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same jumping issue remained.</p>\n<h3>Even more realism</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/QmS1uK893oUJvqeTfm8pBTHo4U5JVzzBsGb7DeSp32uiAf\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>I tried recreating a real roller coaster's wheel system by having wheels above and below the track.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/QmcmD8ZRqs6MXhi4KFjYaPo885F3WWDFs3RNoy6XtJNP9x\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>This still had the same issues and it was boggling my mind.</p>\n<h3>Multiple meshes</h3>\n<p>After more research, I discovered that the issue probably stems from the fact that multiple colliders are being used. Combining the colliders will surely help!</p>\n<p>To do this, I created many planes where the colliders before used to be and merged them into one.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">//Create cubes and offset them based on each bone&#39;s position\nfor (int b = 0; b &lt; bones.Count; b++) {\n    float size;\n\n    if (b + 1 &gt;= bones.Count || (b + 1) % rollerCoaster.boneAmount == 0) {\n        //if there is no next position, use the last position instead\n        size = lastSize;\n    } else {\n        Vector3 nextPosition = bones[b + 1].position;\n        size = Vector3.Distance(bones[b].position, nextPosition) / GameController.instance.scale;\n    }\n\n    cubes[b] = CreatePlane(offset + bones[b].position / GameController.instance.scale, new Vector3(1, 1, size), bones[b].rotation);\n\n    lastSize = size;\n}</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This still was having jumping issues, which made no sense.</p>\n<h3>Simplifying mesh</h3>\n<p>I concluded that this must be because each track is still being treated as a seperate mesh, even though it is all combined into one. I tried using resources to simplify the mesh with no luck.</p>\n<p>After all this, I learned that this physics engine is not practical to make a realistic roller coaster simulation with.</p>\n<h1>Custom Approach</h1>\n<p>Time and time again, I learn how much making a custom system works better than trying to use many other systems together to do something it was never designed for.</p>\n<p>I also learned how making custom physics will help me so much in the future when I will need to calculate the g-forces of the roller coasters to determine intensity and other statistics.</p>\n<p>To do this, I thought of the track as a straight line, and made the position variable just be specifying the position on that straight line.</p>\n<p>Each frame, the velocity must be added to the position (divided by the physics frame rate)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">position += velocity / 60f;</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>And each frame, the acceleration must be added to the velocity.
