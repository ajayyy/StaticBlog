The red squares can only go through red exits and the blue squares can only go through blue exits, etc. The physics work similar to the game 2048, where when you press a direction key (W A S or D), then all the colored blocks you have selected go in that direction the farthest possible.</p>\n<h1>How is it made</h1>\n<p>This is made in Java with no extra libraries. The art is made in Inkscape.</p>\n<p>To use this project, just download the git repo, and open it up with the Eclipse IDE.</p>\n<h1>Image</h1>\n<p><img src=\"/images/1ce0.png\" alt=\"Image 1\">\n<img src=\"/images/1cdf.png\" alt=\"Image 2\"></p>\n<h1>Download</h1>\n<p>You can download it <a href=\"http://ajayinkingston.com/LD%20games/ld38/EscapeTheWorld.jar\">here</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 06, 2017","path":"/escape-the-world-a-puzzle-game-about-finding-exits","title":"Escape The World, A Puzzle Game About Finding Exits"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
