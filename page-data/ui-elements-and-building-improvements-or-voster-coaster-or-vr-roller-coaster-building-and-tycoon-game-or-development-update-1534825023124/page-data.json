To make this possible, I made floating windows. When you drag on a part of the window that is not a button, then the window will move, otherwise the button will be pressed.</p>\n<p>I also added separate images for hovering a button.</p>\n<p>Main files:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoaster/pull/17/files#diff-a23ba8873925244e5a1301ad6d9cf68d\">https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoaster/pull/17/files#diff-a23ba8873925244e5a1301ad6d9cf68d</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoaster/pull/17/files#diff-ed5979ecb002b25add9254d85a4ca478\">https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoaster/pull/17/files#diff-ed5979ecb002b25add9254d85a4ca478</a></p>\n<h1>Track Building Improvements</h1>\n<p>The track was being offset compared to the actual controller position. This was very bad because it made it so that completing a roller coaster automatically does not work perfectly. This was able to be fixed by offsetting the controller's position.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">Vector3 targetPositonOffset = new Vector3(0, 0, trackWidth / 2);\n             \ntargetPosition += targetPositonOffset;</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<h1>Fixed Physics Issues</h1>\n<p>There was an issue where an uphill track was thought to be a downhill track if it was in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>This was caused by the incline using the y axis rotation when that was not necessary.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c#\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-c# line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-c#\">//necessary to get accurate inclines from inclines after turns\ninclineAngleOfTrack -= eulerAnglesOfTrack.y;</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<h1>Pull Request</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoaster/pull/17\">https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoaster/pull/17</a></p>\n<h4>GitHub Account</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy\">https://github.com/ajayyy</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 21, 2018","path":"/ui-elements-and-building-improvements-or-voster-coaster-or-vr-roller-coaster-building-and-tycoon-game-or-development-update-1534825023124","title":"UI Elements and Building Improvements | Voster Coaster | VR Roller Coaster Building and Tycoon Game | Development Update"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
