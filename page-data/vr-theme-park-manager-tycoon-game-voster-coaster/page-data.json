I plan to implement all the features of a theme park management tycoon game, the ability to build roller coasters, rides, food stands, paths, and need to manager your money the whole time. I also want to make it so that you can switch from miniature mode, to human scale to walk around your park like it was a real thing.</p>\n<h1>Technology</h1>\n<p>This being built with Unity and the SteamVR plugin. The headset I own is the Samsung Oddesey Windows MR headset, but I'm building it with SteamVR so that it will support all major PC based VR headsets.</p>\n<p>This is a room scale game, meaning you can walk around.</p>\n<h1>Contributing</h1>\n<p>I plan on making some task requests for some 3D models in the future, but for now, if you want to help me with the project, you can <a href=\"https://discord.gg/6TAPnTx\">join my discord</a> so that we can coordinate our work.</p>\n<p>To help with the programming, you must have a VR headset, download Unity, SteamVR, and then open the project in Unity.</p>\n<p>For helping with models, you do not need a VR headset as you would not need to test the full game.</p>\n<h1>Try it out</h1>\n<p>If you do want to try it out and have a VR headset, you can download an alpha build <a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/VosterCoasterVR/releases\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 26, 2018","path":"/vr-theme-park-manager-tycoon-game-voster-coaster","title":"VR Theme Park Manager Tycoon Game - Voster Coaster!"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
