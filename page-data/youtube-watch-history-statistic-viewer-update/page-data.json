Now, you can save your watch history database every year, and get a year by year statistic viewer of the whole history of your viewing on YouTube.</p>\n<p>I have also made a nice download page to show off features of the program.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/yhfujxjkoptx26tehtj2.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>You can see the live site at <a href=\"http://YoutubeSta.ts.io/\">YoutubeSta.ts.io</a></p>\n<h1>Logos</h1>\n<p>I also recently made a task request for logos, and got many responses. All the logos are really good, thank you.</p>\n<h1>Pull Requests</h1>\n<p>You can see all of the commits I have done in these three pull requests</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/YouTube-Watch-History-Statistic-Viewer/pull/23\">https://github.com/ajayyy/YouTube-Watch-History-Statistic-Viewer/pull/23</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/YouTube-Watch-History-Statistic-Viewer/pull/25\">https://github.com/ajayyy/YouTube-Watch-History-Statistic-Viewer/pull/25</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/YouTube-Watch-History-Statistic-Viewer/pull/26\">https://github.com/ajayyy/YouTube-Watch-History-Statistic-Viewer/pull/26</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 29, 2017","path":"/youtube-watch-history-statistic-viewer-update","title":"YouTube Watch History Statistic Viewer Update"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
