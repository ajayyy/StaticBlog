You can see full details in <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@ajayyy/turn-based-attacker\">the original post</a>.</p>\n<h1>What was added</h1>\n<p>I added many things in this release.</p>\n<p>I added a scoreboard to the end of the game to show the winners and losers, and to see who died last.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/brrbvtchqc6a7uzvadgu.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>I also added color fading, so when the current player switches, it won't immediatly change the color, but slowly fade to not hurt your eyes. I also added many animations for things spawning in, to make the whole game look smoother overall.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/i53fnxi52chjr0h0pqmn.gif\" alt=\"2a86d39e-1393-445e-969b-3c8443de8333.gif\"></p>\n<p>But, the most important thing I added was game saving, you can now save your game and load it for later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/gkpupojafojelrhwwufi.png\" alt=\"image.png\"></p>\n<p>I also added many playabilty fixes like making the pickups spawn throughout the gameplay so you never run out.</p>\n<h1>Future</h1>\n<p>I plan to add LAN multiplayer, and revamp the overall look.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 18, 2018","path":"/turn-based-attacker-playablity-and-polish","title":"Turn Based Attacker - Playablity, Polish, and Save/Load"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
