This is useful when there is something that needs be skipped in the audio, such as an audible sponsor message, while the video on-screen is important. This will also be able to be used to remove those annoying bell sounds that are sometimes added for reminding people to subscribe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/unmute-notice.png\" alt=\"Unmute Notice\"></p>\n<p>This new action can be used with Sponsor, Unpaid/Self Promotion and Interaction Reminder.</p>\n<p>One other cool thing I have noticed with this is that mute segments can get even more precise than skips. With skipping, the browser sometimes acts up when it skips a very short amount of time, making it a better experience just to not skip it at all. With muting segments, it feels a lot smoother and you don't really notice the muting happen.</p>\n<p>As with normal segments, you have the option to unmute at any time to hear what is actually happening.</p>\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/releases/tag/3.1\">3.1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sponsor.ajay.app/donate\">Support my work on SponsorBlock</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 04, 2021","path":"/mute-sponsorblock","title":"Mute Segments - SponsorBlock"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
